## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia. My research focuses on **Macroeconomics**, with a particular interest in **Monetary and Fiscal Policy**, **Banking Regulations**, and **Finance**.

Before joining UVA, I worked as a Quantitative Analyst at **ANZ Banking Group** and **IDFC First Bank**, where I specialized in credit risk modeling. I hold an M.Phil. in Development Studies from **IGIDR, Mumbai**, and an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the **University of Hyderabad**.

I am always open to discussing research and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at [vzw5ab@virginia.edu](mailto:vzw5ab@virginia.edu).
