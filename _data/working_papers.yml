  abstract: "This paper studies how unconventional fiscal financing reshapes the allocation and nature of sovereign risk across economic agents. I document cross-country differences in who absorbs these risks and in the forms those risks take. I then characterize the optimal allocation of risk given key institutional and policy constraints."

  abstract: "In this paper, I study how the U.S. debt management increasingly relies on financial repression as the 'exorbitant privilege' erodes. Historical evidence reveals a policy entanglement: Financial regulations that once targeted stability can quietly support Treasury financing. As external demand wanes, the Treasury might look toward domestic households to hold its debt at a discount, making the fiscal-macroprudential nexus critical. I link leverage constraints to the government budget constraint by extending the continuous-time Kiyotaki-Moore model. When productive borrowers face borrowing limits, savers look towards government assets for returns. The model shows this hidden cost: tighter financial regulation can ease government financing but distorts capital allocation. The stakes are clear: as fiscal dominance creeps in, it is pertinent to understand how financial repression reshapes the economic arrangements and what it implies for the institutional design."
